Project: Demand Forecasting 

Domain: ML 

Topic: Demand Forecasting: 

Description: This project is an implementation of Demand Forecasting method using Holt’s Winter Exponential Smoothing. The dataset used for this project was taken from Kaggle which had a completion named “Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge”. This project was implemented using Google Colab and is even uploaded on GitHub. 

 

Dataset: The dataset available on Kaggle had many more entries and 4 columns but for my convenience I reduced the dataset to only 2 columns viz. Date and Sales from year 2013 to year 2014.  

 

Working:  

For Demand Forecasting I used the Holt’s Winter Exponential Smoothing method. In the used dataset monthly sales of years 2013 and 2014 were given, and I plotted the sales of year 2013 and tried to predict the sales of year 2014. To do so, I did the following steps on colab file: 

Upload the file. 

Imported the various libraries required. 

Reading the dataset. 

Plotted the dataset. 

Applied HWES model. 

Printed the summary. 

Forecasted the sales for year 2014. 

 

Assumptions:  

For ease I reduced the dataset values. 

For more ease I reduced daily sales data into monthly sales data.
